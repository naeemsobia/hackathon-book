# Lesson 5.1: Actuators for Humanoid Robots: Electric, Hydraulic, and Pneumatic

:::note Objective
This lesson provides a review of the different types of actuators used in humanoid robotics, including electric motors, hydraulic actuators, and pneumatic actuators, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each.

## The Role of Actuators

Actuators are the "muscles" of a robot. They are the devices that convert energy into motion, and they are what allow a robot to move and interact with the world.

## Electric Motors

Electric motors are the most common type of actuator used in robotics. They are relatively inexpensive, efficient, and easy to control.

### Types of Electric Motors:

*   **DC Motors**: These are the simplest and most common type of electric motor. They are typically used in applications where high speed and low torque are required.
*   **Stepper Motors**: These motors move in discrete steps, which makes them easy to control with a high degree of precision. They are typically used in applications where precise positioning is required, such as 3D printers and CNC machines.
*   **Servo Motors**: These are DC motors that are combined with a feedback controller, which allows them to be controlled with a high degree of accuracy. They are typically used in applications where both high speed and high precision are required, such as robotics and radio-controlled cars.

## Hydraulic Actuators

Hydraulic actuators use a fluid, such as oil, to transmit power. They are able to generate very large forces, which makes them well-suited for applications where high power is required, such as construction equipment and large industrial robots.

However, hydraulic actuators are also large, heavy, and messy, and they require a separate pump and reservoir to operate. This makes them less suitable for use in humanoid robots, where size and weight are at a premium.

## Pneumatic Actuators

Pneumatic actuators use a gas, such as air, to transmit power. They are lightweight, compliant, and safe, which makes them well-suited for applications where a high degree of safety and compliance is required, such as collaborative robots and medical robots.

However, pneumatic actuators are also less precise than electric or hydraulic actuators, and they are not able to generate as much force. This makes them less suitable for use in applications where high precision or high power is required.

:::tip Key Takeaways
*   **Actuators** are the "muscles" of a robot, converting energy into motion.
*   **Electric motors** are the most common type of actuator used in robotics, and they are available in a variety of different types, including DC motors, stepper motors, and servo motors.
*   **Hydraulic actuators** are able to generate very large forces, but they are also large, heavy, and messy.
*   **Pneumatic actuators** are lightweight, compliant, and safe, but they are also less precise and less powerful than other types of actuators.
