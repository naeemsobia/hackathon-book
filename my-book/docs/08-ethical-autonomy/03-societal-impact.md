# Lesson 8.3: The Societal Impact of Humanoid Robots: Jobs, Bias, and Social Norms

:::note Objective
This lesson explores the broader societal implications of humanoid robotics, from the future of work to the problem of algorithmic bias, and discusses the challenges and opportunities in creating a future where humans and robots can coexist in a way that is both productive and harmonious.

## The Future of Work

One of the most pressing concerns about the rise of robotics is the impact that it will have on the future of work. As robots become more capable, they will be able to perform a wider range of tasks, and this could lead to job losses in some sectors of the economy.

However, it is also possible that robots will create new jobs, by automating the more tedious and dangerous tasks, and by freeing up humans to focus on more creative and strategic work. The future of work is likely to involve a combination of both of these trends, with some jobs being lost, some jobs being created, and many jobs being transformed.

## Algorithmic Bias

Another major concern is the problem of algorithmic bias. If a robot is trained on biased data, it may learn to perpetuate and even amplify those biases. For example, if a robot is trained on a dataset of images that contains more pictures of men than women, it may be more likely to recognize men than women.

There are a number of different techniques that can be used to mitigate algorithmic bias, including:

*   **Data Augmentation**: By augmenting the training data with additional examples, we can help to reduce the bias in the dataset.
*   **Fairness-Aware Machine Learning**: By using fairness-aware machine learning algorithms, we can train models that are less likely to perpetuate and amplify biases.
*   **Auditing and Transparency**: By auditing our models for bias, and by being transparent about the data and algorithms that we are using, we can help to build trust and to ensure that our models are fair and equitable.

## Social Norms

The rise of robotics will also have a major impact on our social norms. As we become more accustomed to interacting with robots, our expectations and behaviors are likely to change. For example, we may become more comfortable with the idea of robots in our homes, our schools, and our workplaces.

It is important to be mindful of these changes, and to ensure that the development of robotics is guided by a clear set of ethical principles.

:::tip Key Takeaways
*   The rise of robotics will have a major impact on the **future of work**, with some jobs being lost, some jobs being created, and many jobs being transformed.
*   **Algorithmic bias** is a major concern in robotics, and there are a number of different techniques that can be used to mitigate it.
*   The rise of robotics will also have a major impact on our **social norms**, and it is important to be mindful of these changes.
