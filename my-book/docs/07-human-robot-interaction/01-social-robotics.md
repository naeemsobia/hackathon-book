# Lesson 7.1: Social Robotics and Communication

:::note Objective
This lesson introduces the field of social robotics and explores how to design robots that can interact with humans in a natural, intuitive, and socially acceptable way.
:::

## What is Social Robotics?

Social robotics is a field of robotics that is concerned with the study and design of robots that can interact and communicate with humans. Social robots are designed to be more than just tools; they are designed to be companions, assistants, and partners.

### Key Goals of Social Robotics:

*   **Natural Interaction**: To create robots that can interact with humans in a way that is similar to the way that humans interact with each other.
*   **Social Acceptance**: To create robots that are accepted by society and that are seen as a positive addition to our lives.
*   **Long-Term Engagement**: To create robots that can maintain a long-term relationship with their users.

## Communication in Social Robotics

Communication is a key aspect of social robotics. Social robots need to be able to communicate with humans in a variety of different ways, including:

*   **Verbal Communication**: The ability to speak and to understand spoken language.
*   **Non-Verbal Communication**: The ability to communicate through body language, gestures, and facial expressions.
*   **Affective Communication**: The ability to communicate emotions and to understand the emotions of others.

## The Uncanny Valley

The "uncanny valley" is a term that was coined by Masahiro Mori to describe the feeling of unease or revulsion that people experience when they encounter a robot that is very human-like, but not quite human enough.

The uncanny valley is a major challenge in social robotics, as it can make it difficult to create robots that are both likable and believable. One way to avoid the uncanny valley is to design robots that are not overly realistic, but that are still able to communicate in a clear and expressive way.

:::tip Key Takeaways
*   **Social robotics** is the study and design of robots that can interact and communicate with humans.
*   **Communication** is a key aspect of social robotics, and it includes verbal, non-verbal, and affective communication.
*   The **uncanny valley** is a major challenge in social robotics, and it can be avoided by designing robots that are not overly realistic.
