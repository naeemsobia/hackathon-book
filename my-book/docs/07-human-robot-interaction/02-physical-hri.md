# Lesson 7.2: Physical Human-Robot Interaction and Safety

:::note Objective
This lesson explores the challenges of physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) and discusses the techniques that can be used to ensure the safety of humans who are working in close proximity to robots.

## What is Physical Human-Robot Interaction?

Physical human-robot interaction is a subfield of HRI that is concerned with the study and design of robots that can physically interact with humans. This includes a wide range of applications, from collaborative robots that work alongside humans in a factory, to assistive robots that help elderly people with their daily activities.

### Key Challenges in pHRI:

*   **Safety**: Ensuring the safety of humans who are interacting with robots is the most important challenge in pHRI.
*   **Intuitive Interaction**: The interaction between the human and the robot should be intuitive and easy to use.
*   **Adaptability**: The robot should be able to adapt to the human's movements and intentions.

## Safety in pHRI

There are a variety of different techniques that can be used to ensure the safety of humans who are interacting with robots.

### Safety Techniques:

*   **Lightweight Design**: By designing robots that are lightweight, we can reduce the amount of force that is exerted in the event of a collision.
*   **Compliant Actuators**: By using compliant actuators, we can make the robot's joints more "springy," which can help to absorb the energy of an impact.
*   **Soft Robotics**: By using soft materials, we can make the robot's body more deformable, which can help to reduce the risk of injury in the event of a collision.
*   **Collision Detection and Avoidance**: By using sensors to detect the presence of humans, we can program the robot to avoid collisions.
*   **Safety Standards**: There are a number of safety standards that have been developed for industrial robots, such as ISO 10218, and these standards can be adapted for use in pHRI.

## The Future of pHRI

The future of pHRI is likely to involve the development of robots that are able to work even more closely with humans, in a way that is both safe and productive. This will require the development of new technologies, such as advanced sensors, compliant actuators, and intelligent control algorithms.
