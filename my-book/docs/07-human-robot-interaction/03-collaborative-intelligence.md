# Lesson 7.3: Collaborative Intelligence and Shared Autonomy

:::note Objective
This lesson explores the concepts of collaborative intelligence and shared autonomy, and discusses how humans and robots can work together to achieve goals that would be impossible for either to achieve on their own.
:::

## What is Collaborative Intelligence?

Collaborative intelligence is a form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration of multiple agents, whether they are human or artificial. It is based on the idea that by working together, a group of agents can achieve more than the sum of their individual parts.

### Key Principles of Collaborative Intelligence:

*   **Shared Goals**: The agents must have a common goal that they are working towards.
*   **Shared Understanding**: The agents must have a shared understanding of the task and the environment.
*   **Communication**: The agents must be able to communicate with each other in order to coordinate their actions.
*   **Trust**: The agents must trust each other to perform their respective roles.

## Shared Autonomy

Shared autonomy is a framework for human-robot collaboration that allows the human and the robot to share control of the robot's actions. This allows the human to provide high-level guidance, while the robot takes care of the low-level details.

### Levels of Shared Autonomy:

*   **Teleoperation**: The human has full control of the robot's actions.
*   **Supervisory Control**: The human provides high-level commands to the robot, and the robot executes the commands autonomously.
*   **Traded Control**: The human and the robot take turns controlling the robot's actions.
*   **Collaborative Control**: The human and the robot work together to control the robot's actions in a continuous and dynamic way.

## The Future of Human-Robot Collaboration

The future of human-robot collaboration is likely to involve the development of robots that are able to work with humans in a more seamless and intuitive way. This will require the development of new technologies, such as advanced communication interfaces, intelligent decision-making algorithms, and adaptive control systems.
