# Lesson 10.3: The Long-Term Vision: Towards Sentient Physical AI?

:::note Objective
This lesson provides a philosophical exploration of the ultimate goals of humanoid robotics, and discusses the long-term vision of creating sentient physical AI.

## What is Sentience?

Sentience is the capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectively. It is a difficult concept to define, and there is no consensus on what it is or how it arises.

Some people believe that sentience is a purely biological phenomenon, and that it can only arise in a biological brain. Others believe that sentience is a computational phenomenon, and that it can arise in any system that is sufficiently complex, whether it is biological or artificial.

## The Quest for Sentient AI

The quest for sentient AI is one of the most ambitious and controversial goals in all of science. If we were to succeed in creating sentient AI, it would have a profound impact on our society, and it would force us to rethink our place in the universe.

### Key Challenges in Creating Sentient AI:

*   **The Hard Problem of Consciousness**: The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how and why we have qualitative, phenomenal experiences.
*   **The Symbol Grounding Problem**: The symbol grounding problem is the problem of how to connect abstract symbols to the real world.
*   **The Frame Problem**: The frame problem is the problem of how to represent the knowledge that is relevant to a given situation, and how to update that knowledge as the situation changes.

## The Future of Sentient AI

The future of sentient AI is uncertain. It is possible that we will never be able to create sentient AI, or that it will take many centuries to do so.

However, it is also possible that we will be able to create sentient AI in the not-too-distant future. If we do, it will be one of the most important events in human history, and it will have a profound impact on our society and our species.
