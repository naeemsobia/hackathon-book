# Lesson 10.2: The Role of Humanoid Robots in Space Exploration, Healthcare, and Daily Life

:::note Objective
This lesson explores the potential applications of humanoid robots in a variety of domains, from space exploration and healthcare to our daily lives.
:::

## Space Exploration

Humanoid robots have the potential to play a major role in the future of space exploration. They can be used to perform tasks that are too dangerous or too difficult for humans, such as exploring the surface of Mars or repairing satellites in orbit.

### Examples of Humanoid Robots in Space:

*   **Robonaut 2**: Robonaut 2 is a humanoid robot that was developed by NASA to work alongside astronauts on the International Space Station.
*   **Valkyrie**: Valkyrie is a humanoid robot that was developed by NASA to be able to operate in degraded or damaged human-engineered environments, such as those that might be found on a disaster-stricken planet.

## Healthcare

Humanoid robots also have the potential to revolutionize the field of healthcare. They can be used to assist with a variety of tasks, such as surgery, rehabilitation, and elder care.

### Examples of Humanoid Robots in Healthcare:

*   **Da Vinci Surgical System**: The Da Vinci Surgical System is a robotic surgical system that is used to perform a wide variety of minimally invasive surgical procedures.
*   **Pepper**: Pepper is a humanoid robot that is used in a variety of healthcare settings, from hospitals and nursing homes to private homes. Pepper can be used to provide companionship, to remind patients to take their medication, and to monitor their vital signs.

## Daily Life

In the future, humanoid robots are likely to become a common sight in our daily lives. They will be used to perform a variety of tasks, from cleaning our homes and mowing our lawns to delivering our packages and providing us with customer service.

### Examples of Humanoid Robots in Daily Life:

*   **ASIMO**: ASIMO is a humanoid robot that was developed by Honda to be a helper to people.
*   **Atlas**: Atlas is a humanoid robot that was developed by Boston Dynamics. Atlas is able to walk, run, and even perform complex gymnastic routines.

:::tip Key Takeaways
*   Humanoid robots have the potential to play a major role in a variety of domains, including **space exploration**, **healthcare**, and **daily life**.
*   There are a number of **examples of humanoid robots** that are already being used in these domains, such as Robonaut 2, Valkyrie, the Da Vinci Surgical System, Pepper, ASIMO, and Atlas.
*   The future of humanoid robotics is likely to involve the development of robots that are even more **capable and intelligent** than the ones that we have today.
