# Lesson 9.1: The Importance of Open-Source Software and Hardware in Robotics

:::note Objective
This lesson highlights the importance of open-source software and hardware in the field of robotics, and discusses how a more collaborative and transparent research culture can help to accelerate the pace of innovation.
:::

## What is Open Source?

Open source is a term that originally referred to open-source software (OSS). Open-source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

The principles of open source have since been applied to hardware, with the development of open-source hardware (OSH). Open-source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.

## The Benefits of Open Source in Robotics

*   **Accelerated Innovation**: By sharing code and designs, we can avoid reinventing the wheel, and we can build on the work of others to create more advanced and capable robots.
*   **Lower Costs**: Open-source software and hardware can help to lower the cost of robotics research and development, making it more accessible to a wider range of people.
*   **Improved Reliability**: By making code and designs publicly available, we can allow a wider community of people to review and to test them, which can help to improve their reliability and to identify and to fix bugs.
*   **Reproducibility**: Open-source software and hardware can help to make robotics research more reproducible, which is essential for scientific progress.

## Examples of Open Source in Robotics

*   **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.
*   **Gazebo**: Gazebo is an open-source 3D robotics simulator. It makes it possible to rapidly test algorithms, design robots, and perform regression testing with realistic scenarios.
*   **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**: OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
*   **The Poppy Project**: The Poppy Project is an open-source platform for the creation, use and sharing of interactive 3D printed robots. It is a community of beginners and experts, scientists, educators, artists and developers, who all share a vision that robots are powerful tools to learn and create.

:::tip Key Takeaways
*   **Open-source software and hardware** can help to accelerate the pace of innovation in robotics.
*   The benefits of open source in robotics include **accelerated innovation**, **lower costs**, **improved reliability**, and **reproducibility**.
*   There are a number of successful examples of open source in robotics, including **ROS**, **Gazebo**, **OpenCV**, and the **Poppy Project**.
